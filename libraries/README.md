# library maintenance

## howto
Follow the explanation in https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/

So we can add projects from another repo and keep ours up to date

## example

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Cerdic/CSSTidy CSSTidy
```

so now we have the external needed library embedded into our project.

Now we can `push` to our repository and files will be updated automagically.

If you don't see the files, please follow instructions pointed at the begining.
